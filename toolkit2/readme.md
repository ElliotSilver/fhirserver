# FHIR Toolkit

This is a general purpose toolkit for working with FHIR Resources and related content.

The FHIR Toolkit specifically supports the following formats:

* FHIR resources in XML and JSON formats
* XML files
* JSON Files
* JWTs (including, specifically, Smart Health Cards)
* Text and Markdown files
* HTML files

In addition to editing files, the FHIR Toolkit can connect directly to FHIR Servers 
and retrieve resources from them and edit/validate the resources.
